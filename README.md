# Dream Machine

This is the Dream Machine source code.

Dream Machine is a webapp where the user can enter

his dream and what is stopping him

and contact information

so that other users can help him archieve his dream.

And if a user already made his dream true, he can ask:

"I already fulfilled my dream but I can help you fulfill yours.

What is your dream and what is stopping you?"
