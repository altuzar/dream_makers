# Dream Makers

This is the Dream Makers source code.

Dream Makers is a webapp where the dreamer can enter

his dream and what is stopping him

and contact information

so that other dreamers can help the dream archieve the dream.

And if a dreamer already made his dream true, we encourage them to say:

"I already fulfilled my dream but I can help you fulfill yours.

What is your dream and what is stopping you?"
